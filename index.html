                        <p>This is your bio... We’ll start by telling people about where you come from, where you live now, who you are and what you do.  That will be the first paragraph.</p>
                        <p>This is where we say amazing things about you because you are so amazing.  This is where we tell the world that you are so talented, and include things you’ve done. Like the song-writing competition.  And your open mic nights.  And your festivals.  Everything.</p>
                        <p>You might include what started your journey.  What ignited the flame that's fueling this dream.  Who were your influences, both personal and musical.  And maybe a little about where you want to go with it next.  Like the podcasts, and the recording, and the shows, and whatever else you might want to include.</p>
